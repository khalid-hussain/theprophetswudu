# Introduction

Verily all praise is for Allah, we praise Him and seek His aid and ask for His forgiveness, and we seek refuge with Allah from the evils of ourselves and our evil actions. Whomever Allah guides there is none who can misguide him, and whomever Allah misguides there is none who can guide him, and I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah Alone, having no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.

«O mankind! Revere your Guardian-Lord, Who created you from a single person, created, of like nature his mate, and from them twain scattered countless men and women; revere Allah, through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and (revere) the wombs (that bore you): for Allah ever watches over you.» (Sūrah al-Nisā, 1)

«O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam.» (Sūrah Āl ʿImrān, 102)

«O you who believe! Fear Allah, and (always) say a word did to the right that He may make your conduct whole and sound and forgive you your sins: He who obeys Allah and His Messenger, has already attained the highest achievement.» (Sūrah al-Aḥzāb, 70--71)

As for what follows: Verily the most truthful speech is the Word of Allah and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad \pbuh, and the worst of affairs are the novelties and
every novelty is an innovation and every innovation is a going astray and every going astray is in the Fire.

I desired to write this as a completion for the treatises which are in circulation amongst the people today---about the different fields---especially of worship such as prayer and fasting, etc. which have made easier that which is difficult as regards religious rulings and being guided thereby, as it maybe difficult these days for some to read, research and extract these rulings from their places within the
source books, either because of the ignorance of the Muslims or laziness or other worldly problems. I sincerely advise all the Muslims to read and research until they come to know and understand their true _Dīn_.

I wished to write this in order to complete the series of the types of worship, especially since no one has particularized this topic in a treatise---except what occurs within the books of reference as we have explained---but I have not found this in the form of a treatise.

My method for this treatise has been not to quote except what is authentic from the _ḥadīth_ of the Messenger of Allah \pbuh---if Allah wishes---ordering it according to the order of the _Wuḍū_ of the Messenger of Allah \pbuh, and I have commented on some of the points about which there is difference of opinion, stating that which is correct therefrom in our view after replying to the other opinions.

I ask Allah to guide us to that which is proper. Verily He is the One having authority over that and having the Power to do so.


# The Definition of Wuḍū


## Arabic Language

_Wuḍū_ is the action, and _Waḍū_ the water used therefore---and it is also a verbal noun; or they are two forms of the same word, both meaning the verbal-noun and maybe both referring also to the water used.
 
## Shariah
 
_Wuḍū_ is using clean and cleansing (_ṭuhūr_) water upon certain body parts as Allah has prescribed and explained.


# The Prescription of Wuḍū in the Kitāb and Sunnah

Allah says,

> O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces,
> and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water);
> and (wash) your feet to the ankles.
> (Sūrah al-Māʾidah, Q5:7)

1. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “The _ṣalāh_ of anyone of you breaching purification is not accepted unless he makes wuḍū.”[^1]

2. Ibn ʿUmar \mabpwthemtwo said: Indeed I heard the Emissary of Allah \pbuh say, “Allah does not accept _ṣalāh_ without purification, nor _ṣadaqah_ from illegally attained wealth.”[^2]

3. Ibn ʿAbbās \mabpwthemtwo said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Verily I have been ordered to make _wuḍū_ when I stand for _ṣalāh_.”[^3]

4. Abū Saʿīd \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “The key to _ṣalāh_ is purification, its _taḥrīm_[^4] is the _takbīr_ and its _taḥlīl_[^5] is the giving of _salām_.”[^6]

# The Excellence of Wuḍū

1. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh said, “Shall I not guide you to that
  by which Allah wipes away the sins and raises the ranks? They
  said: Certainly O Emissary of Allah! He said Completing the
  _wuḍū_ when it is a hardship, and many steps to the mosques and
  waiting for the [next] prayer after the prayer, that is
  _al-Ribāṭ_ (defending the frontiers); that is _al-Ribāṭ_; that is
  _al-Ribāṭ_.”[^7]

2. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim reports that Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh said, “When the Muslim (or
  'Believing') servant makes _wuḍū_ and washes his face then the sin of
  everything he looked at with his eye comes away with the water, or
  with the last drop of the water, and when he washes his hands then
  the sin of everything he stretched out his hands to comes away with
  the water, or with the last drop of the water. And when he washes
  his feet every sin which his feet walked towards comes away with the
  water or with the last drop of the water---so that he leaves clean
  (clear/pure) from sins.”[^8]

3. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim reports that Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh came to the graveyard and said, “Peace be upon you, dwelling of Believing People and we will (all)
  if Allah wills join you soon. I would have liked to have seen our
  brothers!” They said, “Are we not your brothers, O Emissary of
  Allah?” He \pbuh said, “You are my Companions and our brothers are those
  who have not yet come!” They said, “How will you know those who have
  not yet come from your _Ummah_, O Emissary of Allah?” He said, “Have
  you not seen that if a man had a horse with a white blaze and hoof
  along with a totally jet-black horse, then would he not know his
  horse?” They said, “Certainly, O Emissary of Allah.” He said, “So
  they will come with white blazes and marks from the _wuḍū_ and I am
  present before them at the Hand (_water-tank_). Indeed men will be
  driven away from my _water-tank_ as the lost camel is driven away
  from their gathering place. ‘Come on.’ So it will be said: ‘Indeed
  they have made changes after you,’ so I will say, ‘Be off, be off.’”[^9]

4. Abū Umāmah \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “When a Muslim makes _wuḍū_ the sins he has
  committed come away from his hearing and from his sight and from his
  hand and from his feet, so when he sits he sits down having been
  forgiven.”[^10]

5. Abū Mālik al-Ashʿarī \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Purification is half of Īmān;
  and _alḥamdulillāh_ fills the Scales; and _subḥānAllāh_ and
  _alḥamdulillāh_ fill whatever is between the heaven and the
  earth; and _Ṣalāh_ is a light; and _Ṣadaqah_ is a clear proof; and _Ṣabr_
  (patience) is a shining light; and the Quran is a proof for or
  against you. Every person starts the day dealing for his own soul so
  he either sets it free or destroys it.”[^11]

6. ʿUthmān \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Whoever makes _wuḍū_ and makes it well, his sins
  come out from his body, even coming out from under his nails.”[^12]

7. ʿUthmān \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Whoever makes _wuḍū_ like this---then all of his
  previous sins are forgiven---and his _Ṣalāh_ and his walking to the
  masjid are above and beyond that.”[^13]

8. Ibn 'Umar \mabpwthemtwo said: The Emissary of Allah said, “When one of you makes _wuḍū_ and
  makes it well, then goes out to the masjid---having no purpose
  except _Ṣalāh_---then his left foot continues to wipe away his evil
  deeds and his right foot continually writes for him good deeds until
  he enters the masjid. And if the people knew what there was in the
  night prayer and Subh prayers, then they would come to them even if
  they had to crawl.[^14]

9. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Whoever makes _wuḍū_ and makes it well then
  goes out---and then finds that the people have finished the _Ṣalāh_---
  then Allah gives him the same reward as one who had prayed it along
  with the people without diminishing any of their reward.[^15]

10. Zayd ibn Khālid al-Juhanī \mabpwhim relates that the
  Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Whoever makes _wuḍū_
  and makes it well, then prays two _rakʿahs_ not letting his mind
  wander in them---then Allah forgives him all of his previous
  sins.”[^16]

11. ʿUqbah ibn ʿĀmir \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh said, “Whoever makes _wuḍū_ and makes
  it well, then prays two _rakʿahs_ concentrating therein with his heart
  and his face---then Paradise is obligatory for him.”[^17]

12. ʿUthmān \mabpwhim said: I heard the Emissary of Allah \pbuh say, “Whoever makes _wuḍū_ for _Ṣalāh_ and
  completes the _wuḍū_---then walks to the obligatory _Ṣalāh_ and prays
  it with the people---or with the congregation---or in the mosque---then Allah forgives his sins.”[^18]

13. ʿAlī \mabpwhim relates that the Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Completing the _wuḍū_ when it is a
  hardship, and walking to the masjid, and waiting for the next prayer
  after the previous one (greatly) washes away the sins.”[^19]

14. Humrān ibn Abān relates that ʿUthmān asked for water to make
  _wuḍū_---then he mentioned how the Emissary of Allah \pbuh made _wuḍū_.
  Then he \mabpwhim said, “The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said at the end of the _ḥadīth_, 
  ‘Whoever makes _wuḍū_ in the same way that I have just made _wuḍū_ then
  stands up and prays two _rakʿahs_, not thinking of other things, then
  his previous sins are forgiven.’”[^20]

# The Components of Wuḍū

## Al-Nīyyah (Intention)

This is the firm resolve of the heart to perform
_wuḍū_ in obedience to the order of Allah \swt and His Emissary
\pbuh. Ibn Taymiyyah \mercy said in _Majmūʿah al-Rasāʾil al-Kubrā_ (1/243):
“The place of the _niyyah_ is the heart and not the tongue in all forms of
_ʿibādah_---and that is agreed upon by all the Muslim scholars---Purification,
_Ṣalāh_, _Zakāt_, _Ṣawm_, _Ḥajj_, _ʿItq_ (freeing of slaves), _Jihād_, etc.
If he were to express with his tongue other than that which he intended in
his heart---then what he intended is counted, not what he said. If he voiced the
intention with his tongue and the intention was not in his heart, that
will not count---by total agreement of all the scholars of Islam---so
the _niyyah_ is the firm intention and resolve itself.”

As the Emissary of Allah \pbuh himself explained in the _ḥadīth_ narrated by ʿUmar \mabpwhim
in the _Ṣaḥīḥayn_, “Verily the actions are by intention and there is for everyone only
what he intended...”[^21]

## Al-Tasmīyyah (Mentioning Allāh's Name)

1. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said that the Emissary of Allah \pbuh
  said “There is no _wuḍū_ for him who does not mention Allah's name
  upon it.”[^22]

    Imam Aḥmad in one of his two sayings is of the opinion that it is
    obligatory in _wuḍū_, _ghusl_, and _tayammum_. He was followed in this
    opinion by Abū Bakr, and it is the saying of al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī and
    Imam Isḥāq---as reported by Ibn Qudāmah in _al-Mughnī_ (1/84), and
    their proof is this _ḥadīth_.
 
    Ibn Qudāmah adds in _al-Mughnī_: If we take the saying that it is
    obligatory,then the _wuḍū_ of one who deliberately leaves it is not
    correct as he has left an obligatory duty in Purification---just as
    if he had left the intention; and if he left it forgetfully then his
    purification is correct. And this is the saying that we regard as
    being correct.

    As for Ibn Taymiyyah \mercy, he held it to be obligatory if the
    related _ḥadīth_ was authentic---as occurs in his _Kitāb al-Īmān_---
    and the _ḥadīth_ is authentic, so therefore his opinion is that it is
    obligatory.

2. Al-Bukhārī and Muslim report from Anas \mabpwhim that some of the
    Companions of the Prophet \pbuh sought water for _wuḍū_, so the Emissary
    of Allah \pbuh said “Does any of you have water?” So he put his hand
    into the water and said “Make _wuḍū_ in the name of Allah.” And I
    saw the water coming out from between his fingers until they all
    made _wuḍū_.

    Thābit said: “I said to Anas \mabpwhim, ‘How many were
    there?’ He said, ‘About seventy.’”[^23]
 
    As for the proof for that which we have stated---it is his \pbuh
    saying “Make _wuḍū_ in the name of Allah.” As for those who say that
    it is only _sunnah muʾakkadah_, then they base that upon the relative
    _ḥadīth_ being weak. However since the _ḥadīth_ is _ṣaḥīḥ_ as we have
    explained, then there remains no proof for them and the proof is with
    us, and Allah Knows Best.
 
So it is therefore obligatory as we have shown, however the one who
forgets should mention Allah's name when he remembers.

## Washing The Hands

1. Humrān \mabpwhim narrates that ʿUthmān called for water
  to make _wuḍū_ and washed his hands three times... then said, “I saw
  the Emissary of Allah \pbuh make _wuḍū_ just as I have
  made _wuḍū_.”[^24]

2. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said: the Emissary of Allah \pbuh said,
  “When one of you awakes from sleep then let him not enter his hand
  into the bowl/vessel until he washes it three times as he does not
  know where his hand has spent the night.”[^25]

3. And in the _ḥadīth_ of ʿAbd Allāh ibn Zayd \mabpwhim he was
  asked about the _wuḍū_ of the Prophet \pbuh, so he called for
  a bowl of water and made _wuḍū_ from it as the Prophet \pbuh made
  _wuḍū_, and he poured out water from the bowl upon his hand and
  washed it three times.[^26]

4. Aws ibn Abī Aws reports from his grandfather \mabpwhim
  said: I saw the Emissary of Allah \pbuh make
  _wuḍū_ washing his hands three times. \[Aḥmad (4/9), al-Nasāʾī
  (1/55) - with _ṣaḥīḥ_ _isnād_\].


## Al-Maḍmaḍah and al-Istinshāq

_Al-Maḍmaḍah_: Washing the mouth and moving the water around within it.

_Al-Istinshāq_: Taking water into the nose and breathing it into its backmost part.

_Al-Istinthār_: Expulsion of water from the nose after _istinshāq_.

## Washing the Mouth and Nose Together with One Handful (of Water)

1. ʿAbd Allāh ibn Zayd al-Anṣārī said that it was said to him: Perform for us the _wuḍū_ of the Emissary of Allah \pbuh, so he called for a pot of water...until he said, “So he washed his mouth and nose with a single handful and did that three times.”

## Washing the Mouth

1. In the _ḥadīth_ of ʿAmr ibn Yaḥyā \mabpwhim he said: And
  he washed his mouth and nose using three handfuls of water.[^28]

    Imam al-Nawawī says, “...and in this _ḥadīth_ is a clear proof for the correct opinion that the Sunnah in washing the mouth and nose is that it should be with three handfuls of water---washing the mouth and nose [together] with each of them.”

2. In the _ḥadīth_ of ʿĀʾishah \mabpwher in which she describes the _wuḍū_ of the Prophet \pbuh that he said “When you make _wuḍū_ then wash your mouth.”[^29]

## Washing the Nose and Expelling the Water

1. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim narrates that the Prophet \pbuh
  said “When one of you makes _wuḍū_ then let him enter water into his nose, then expel it.”[^30]

2. Exerting in sniffing in the water as long as you are not fasting is
  reported in the _ḥadīth_ of Laqīt \mabpwhim who said, “O Emissary of Allah \pbuh, inform me of the _wuḍū_.” He said “Complete the _wuḍū_ and rub between the fingers and exert in breathing in the water into the nose unless you are fasting.”[^31]

It is clear from these two _aḥādīth_ that washing the mouth and nose
are both obligatory (_wājib_). Ibn Qudāmah says in _al-Mughnī_, “
Washing the nose and washing the mouth are both obligatory in both
forms of purification---_ghusl_ and _wuḍū_---as washing the face is
obligatory in both of them in the established view of the _madhhab_; and
it is the saying of Ibn al-Mubārak, Ibn Abī Laylā and Isḥāq, and was also reported from ʿAtā.”

## Taking Water Into The Nose With The Right Hand And Expelling It With The Left

ʿAbd Khayr said: We were sitting, looking towards ʿAlī as he made _wuḍū_, and he entered into his mouth a handful of water with his right hand and washed his mouth and nose, then expelled it from his nose with his left hand—he did that three times, then said: Whoever would like to see the way of purification of the Emissary of Allah \pbuh, then this is his purification.[^32]

## Washing The Face

The face (_wajh_) is determined as being everything between the
beginning of the hair down to the cheeks and the chin, and up to the
start of the ears including that which is between the beard and ear.

Allah \swt says,

> O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles. [Sūrah al-Māʾidah, 5:7]
 
Humrān ibn Abān narrates that ʿUthmān \mabpwhim called
for water to make _wuḍū_ and so mentioned the way in which the Prophet
\pbuh made _wuḍū_. Humrān said: Then he washed his face three times.[^33]

## Running Water Through The Beard With The Fingers

1. ʿUthmān \mabpwhim narrates that the Prophet \pbuh used to run his (wet fingers) through his beard.[^34]

2. Anas \mabpwhim narrates that when the Prophet \pbuh made _wuḍū_, he used to take a handful of water and enter it below his chin and rub it through his beard and said, “This is what my Lord—the Great and Exalted—has ordered me to do.”[^35]

    Some of the scholars have declared that entering water through the beard is obligatory and say: If he deliberately leaves it—then he  must repeat the (_wuḍū_ and) prayer. And this is the saying of Imam Isḥāq and Abū Thawr.
 
    Most of the scholars however are of the opinion that the order is an order of desirability (_istihbāb_) and it is not obligatory—and that it is clearer that that which is obligatory is moving water through that part of the beard...so that it reaches the skin underneath.[^36]
 
    Imams Aḥmad and Layth and most of the scholars hold that moving water through the beard is obligatory when taking _ghusl_ from _Janābah_—and not obligatory in _wuḍū_.[^37]

## Washing The Arms Including The Elbows

[Note]{.smallcaps}: The arms here which we are ordered to wash begin with the fingertips and hands—which are to be included in this washing—they being part of the arm (_yad_) which we are ordered to wash in the _āyah_.

Allāh \swt says:

> O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles. [Sūrah al-Māʾidah, 5:7]

Humrān ibn Abān reports that ʿUthmān \mabpwhim called for water for _wuḍū_ and mentioned the Prophet's \pbuh way of making _wuḍū_—and Humrān said: Then he washed his right arm including the elbow three times, then the left in the same way (al-Bukhārī and Muslim as has preceded).

Regarding inclusion of the elbows in the washing of the arms—scholars have differed: Some of them saying that they must be included in this washing, and others saying that this is not so. And this difference of opinion is due to their disagreement over the meaning of the word _ilā_ (to) in the _āyah_ - does it mean ‘up to/until’ or ‘up to and including’?

He who says that it means ‘up to’ does not include the elbows in the washing—just as Allah \swt says:

> ...thumma 'atimmus-siyaama ilaa -llail: Then complete your fast till the night appears; [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:187]

And this is the opinion of some of the companions of Imam Mālik.

Most scholars, however, hold the view that the meaning is ‘up to and including/along with’—and thus include the elbows in the washing and use as their evidence Allah's \swt saying:

>...wa yayazidkum quwwatan ilaa quwwatikum...(and add strength to your strength); [Sūrah Hūd, 11:52]

1. The proof in this matter is the _ḥadīth_ of Nuʿaym bin Mijmar who
  said, “I saw Abū Hurayrah make _wuḍū_—he washed his face and
  completed the _wuḍū_, then washed his right hand until he reached
  the upper arm, then his left hand till he reached the upper arm”—
  then in the end of the _ḥadīth_ he said: “This is how I saw
  the Emissary of Allah \pbuh make _wuḍū_.” (Muslim, 1/246)

 So, dear reader, it is clear from this _ḥadīth_ that the Prophet
 \pbuh used to wash the elbows further, he
 used to increase upon that and wash part of the upper arm.

2. Jābir \mabpwhim said that when the Prophet \pbuh
  made _wuḍū_, he would pass the water over his
  elbows. (Reported by al-Dāraquṭnī (1/15), al-Bayhaqī (1/56) and
  others; Ibn Ḥajr declared it _ḥasan_; Shaykh al-Albānī declared
  it _ṣaḥīḥ_ (_Ṣaḥīḥ ul-Jāmiʿ_, 4547).

## Wiping the Head and Ears and Imāmah

1. Wiping over all of the head as Allah \pbuh says:

  > ...wamsahoo bi ru'oosikum...: ...rub your heads (with water) [Soorat-ul-Maa'idah 5:7]

  Ibn Qudāmah says: Some of the people who claim that that which
  is ordered to be wiped is part of the head only—claim that the _Bā_
  (in the _āyah_) means “part of” as if He had said: “Wipe part of your
  heads.” However, we say that in His \swt saying wamsahoo bi ru'oosikum
  the _Bā_ is as if He \swt said regarding Tayammum wamsahoo bi wujoohikum
  (Allah \swt orders us to wipe the faces).

  Therefore their saying that the _Bā_ means “part of” is incorrect and
  unknown to the scholars of the language. Ibn Burhān says, “He who
  claims that the _bā_ means ‘part of’ has declared before the scholars
  of the language that of which they have no knowledge.” (_al-Mughnī_ 1/112)

  Imam al-Shawkānī says: It is not established that it means “part of”
  and Sībawayh (one of the foremost scholars of the Arabic language)
  has denied that in fifteen places in his book. (_Nayl al-Awtār_, 1/193).

  In the _ḥadīth_ of ʿAbd Allāh ibn Zayd \mabpwhim is further proof of
  the incorrectness of the saying that it means “a part of”—in that the
  Prophet \pbuh wiped his head with his two hands, moving them forwards
  and backwards—beginning with the front of the head and (wiping) with
  them up to his nape then he \pbuh returned them to the place from which
  he began (al-Fatḥ 1/251, Muslim #235, al-Tirmidhī #28 and others).

2. Wiping the ears: The ruling for the ears is the same as that for the
head.

  It is authentically reported that the Emissary of Allah \pbuh
  said, “The two ears are a part of the head.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhī
  #37; Abū Dāwūd, #134 and Ibn Mājah, #444. It was declared _ṣaḥīḥ_ by
  Shaykh al-Albānī [_al-Ṣaḥīḥah-_, 1/36]. Imam Aḥmad was of the view that
  wiping the ears has the same ruling as that for wiping the head.)

As for those who hold the view that it is a _sunnah_, they do not have
any evidence except their regarding this _ḥadīth_ as being _ḍaʿīf_.
However, it is authentic due to a chain of narration which they did not
come across and so the proof is with our saying—and Allah Knows best.

The scholars who hold that they are part of the head are Ibn al-Musayyib,
ʿAṭā, al-Ḥasan, Ibn Sīrīn, Saʿīd ibn Jubayr and al-Nakhaʾī and it is the
saying of al-Thawrī and Ahl al-Raʾy and Imams Mālik and Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal.

## Taking Fresh Water for the Head and Ears

36. Shaykh al-Albānī says in _al-Ḍaʿīfah_, #995: There is not
  to be found in the Sunnah anything which obligates taking fresh
  water for the ears—therefore he should wipe them along with the
  water for the head—just as it is also permissible to wipe the head
  with the water remaining from that of the arms after washing them
  according to the _ḥadīth_ of al-Rabīʿ bint Muʿawwiḍ that the
  Prophet \pbuh “wiped his head with water remaining in his hand.”
  (Reported by Abū Dāwūd and others with _ḥasan isnād_)

<!-- TODO -->

## The Way of Wiping

36. From ʿAbd Allāh ibn ʿAmr—about the way of performing _wuḍū_—he
  said: Then he \pbuh wiped his head and entered his two forefingers
  into his ears and wiped the backs of his ears with his thumbs.
  (Reported by Abū Dāwūd #135, al-Nasāʾī #140, Ibn Mājah #422
  and authenticated by Ibn Khuzaymah)

## Wiping over the Imāmah only

36. ʿAmr bin Umayyah \mabpwhim said: I saw the Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh wipe over his turban and leather socks.
  (Reported by al-Bukhārī [al Fatḥ, 1/266] and others)

37. Bilāl \mabpwhim reports that the Prophet \pbuh wiped over
  the leather socks and the head cover.
  (Reported by Muslim 1/159)

## Wiping over the turban and forelock

36. Al-Mughīrah bin Shuʿbah \mabpwhim reports that the
  Prophet \pbuh made _wuḍū_ and wiped over his forelock
  and over the turban and leather socks.
  (Reported by Muslim 1/159)

<!-- TODO Stopped here -->

Ibn Qudāmah says in _al-Mughnī_ (1/310); And if part of the head is
uncovered and it is normally so, then it is preferable to wipe over
that along with the turban - that is recorded from Aḥmad: as the
Prophet \pbuh wiped over his turban and
forelock - as occurs in the _ḥadīth_ of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah.

As for caps/'prayer hats', it is not permissible to wipe over them as
Aḥmad says for various reasons, from them: (1) They do not cover all
of the head normally, nor are they tied around it. (2) There is no
difficulty in their removal.

As for the woman's head cover - it is permissible to wipe over it as
Umm Salamah used to wipe over her head cover - as reported by Ibn
al-Mundhir. (See_al-Mughnī_, 1/312).

WASHING THE FEET AND ANKLES
===========================

 Allah ta'ala says: ...wa arjulakum ilaal ka'bayn...: ...and (wash)
 your feet to the ankles \[Soorat-ul-Maa'idah 5:7\] \[thus ordering the
 washing of the feet and ankles\].

36. Ibn 'Umar (radhiAllahu 'anhumaa) said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) fell behind us and then came upon us during a
  journey, then we found him and it was time for 'Asr - so we began to
  make _wuḍū_ and wipe over our feet, so he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) called out at the top of his voice Woe to the ankles from
  the Fire. (two or three times) \[al-Bukhārī (al Fatḥ, 1/232) and
  Muslim, 3/128\].

 al-Nawawī says in his explanation of Sahih Muslim after mentioning the
 _ḥadīth_: Muslim's intention (rahimahullah) in quoting these _ḥadīth_
 was to prove with it the obligation of washing the feet - and that
 wiping them is not sufficient.

36. In the _ḥadīth_ of al-Bukhārī and Muslim from Humrān ibn Abān
  that ʿUthmān \mabpwhim called for water for _wuḍū_ and
  then mentioned the _wuḍū_ of the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) - then Humraan said: Then he washed his right foot to the
  ankle three times and then his left foot to the ankle three times.

37. As Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim did in Muslim's narration:
  "Then he washed his right foot till he reached the shin, then he
  washed the left foot till he reached the

 shin" and in the end of the _ḥadīth_ said: This is what I saw
 the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) do. \[Muslim, 1/246\].
 
 From this _ḥadīth_ - O Brother Muslim - it becomes clear that the
 ankles enter into this washing as is clear from his saying 'till he
 reached the shin'.

36. Al-Mustaurad \mabpwhim said: When the Prophet
  \pbuh made _wuḍū_ he would enter the water
  between his toes with his little finger. \[Reported by Abū Dāwūd
  (#148), at-Tinnidhee (#40) and Ibn Mājah (#446). Declared as
  '_ṣaḥīḥ_' by al-Albānī\].

 As-San'aanee says in 'Subul-us-Salaam' after quoting this _ḥadīth_: It
 is a proof for the obligation of wiping between the toes - and this
 also occurs in the _ḥadīth_ of Ibn 'Abbaas which we have indicated -
 which is reported by al-Tirmidhī, Aḥmad, Ibn Mājah and al-Haakim -
 and authenticated by al-Bukhārī. And it is done by using the little
 finger. (See 'Subul-us-Salaam', 1/48).

36. And Laqeet ibn Sabarah said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  salam) said **Complete the _wuḍū_ and wipe between the Asaabi'**
  (fingers and/or toes). \[Abū Dāwūd (#142), al-Tirmidhī (#37),
  al-Nasāʾī (#114), Ibn Mājah (#407), al-Hakim (1/148).
  al-Albānī says: _ṣaḥīḥ_.\]. As-San'aanee says: It clearly means
  both the fingers and toes and is shown clearly in the _ḥadīth_ of Ibn
  'Abbaas. \[Subul-us-Salaam, 1/47\].

THE REPLY TO THOSE WHO FOLLOW WIPING OF THE FEET WITHOUT WASHING
================================================================

(1) Wiping the feet when not wearing anything on the foot is not
  established from the Prophet \pbuh**.** As
  for their using as a proof the reading of the Aayah: wamsahoo bi
  ru'oosikum wa arjulakum ilaal ka'bayn: rub your heads and your feet
  to the ankles...\[soorat-ul-Maaidah 5:7\] reading (arjulikum) - and
  saying that the feet are thus connected to (the command to wipe) the
  heads - and this is not correct, rather they are connected to (the
  order to wash) the hands. As for the reading of the word (arjulikum)
  with Kasra of the laam - as-San'aanee says That is for wiping over
  the leather socks - as is shown by the Sunnah - and this is the best
  interpretation for this particular recital. (As-Subul, 1/58).

(2) The Qur'aan is not to be explained according to the human
  intellect - especially in the matters of worship such as Salaat and
  _wuḍū_ , etc. - but by the Sunnah which explains this Pillar. And
  there are many such examples in the Qur'an which the Prophet
  \pbuh explained by his sayings - and from
  this is the washing of the feet - and its proof from the Sunnah has
  preceded.

(3) If they wish to use the intellect then we say to them: The bottom of
  the foot has more right to be wiped than the surface (their saying
  being the wiping of the surface), and if they say: Then what about
  the socks? we say: That is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) just as washing the foot is also established in
  the Sunnah.

(4) Leaving out one of two verbs and sufficing with one of them, as the
  Arabs, when two verbs come together having similar meaning and are
  followed by things related

 to them, makes it permissible to mention only one of the two verbs and
 attaching those things relating to the second to those relating to the
 first which is mentioned - according to what the wording demands,
 until it is as if the two are partners with regard to the verb, as the
 poet said: I fed it with hay and cold water. And what is meant is: I
 fed it with hay and gave it cold water to drink.

(1) The saying of az-Zajjaj (a great scholar of the language): It is
  permissible that the wording (arjulikum) has the meaning of 'wash
  the feet' as the wording (ilal Ka'bain) conveys that meaning - as
  the mentioning of a limit suggests washing just as Allah ta'ala
  says ilaal maraafiq \[that is the limit of the elbows is for
  washing\] however, if wiping were intended then there would be no
  need for mention of a limit just as Allah ta'ala says wamsahoo bi
  ru'oosikum not mentioning any limit (for wiping the head) and
  further the term wiping can be used to mean washing. (Al- Mirqaat,
  1/400).

(2) And further, the great majority of scholars have agreed that it is
  obligatory to wash the feet and that is reported - and reaches the
  level of mutawaatir from the Prophet \pbuh
  as al-Haafiz Ibn Ḥajr says; and further it is not established that
  any of the Sahaabah differed regarding that - except what is
  reported from 'Alee, Ibn 'Abbas and Anas (radhiAllahu 'anhum) - and
  it is established that they went back on that. (Al-Mirqaat. 1/400\~.

36. And Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim reports that the Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh came to the graveyard and said
  .**..they will come on the Day of Judgement with their blazes
  shining from the _wuḍū_** (It has preceded, #7). Meaning the
  the Emissary of Allah \pbuh will know from the
  traces of the washing, as for those who do not wash then he will not
  know them on the Day of Judgement.

 Ibn Ḥajr says: And it is established that this shining of the faces,
 hands and feet are particular to the Muslim Ummah.
 
 **OTHER ASPECTS OF _wuḍū_ THE SIWAAK**
 
 The SIWAAK is that which the mouth is brushed with. And it is also
 called the MISWAAK, the plural being: SOOK. And the siwaak comes from
 the Araak tree and it is a well-known tree. Abū Hanifah said: It is
 the best of the trees whose twigs are used for brushing the teeth...
 smelling of milk. Abū Ziyaad said: From it is taken there tooth-sticks
 - from its twigs and roots - and the best part for that is its roots,
 and it is broadly spreading..And Ibn Shameel: The Araak is a tall
 fine-shoot green tree with many leaves and branches, having weak wood
 and growing in hollows - miswaaks are taken from it, being one of the
 citrus trees. Its singular is Araak and its plural Araa-ik.
 (Lisaan-ul-'Arab, 268).
 
 It is mustahabb (desirable) to use the siwaak at many different times
 as is established from the Prophet \pbuh
 that he used to use the siwaak at every Prayer, and before reading the
 Qur'an, and before sleeping and
 
 when waking, and when the breath changes - whether fasting or not - or
 whether at the start of the day or in the afternoon, and it is a form
 of worship which is easy therefore observe it, O my Muslim Brother.

36. And also when making _wuḍū_ , as Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim
  narrates that the Emissary of Allah \pbuh said I**f
  I did not fear to cause hardship to my Ummah I would have ordered
  them to use the siwaak with every _wuḍū_.** \[Reported by
  at-Tirrnidhee (#22) who said: Hasan _ṣaḥīḥ_, and Maalik (#123),
  Aḥmad (4/116), Abū Dāwūd (#37) and others. al-Albānī declared
  it to be _ṣaḥīḥ_ (Takhree; ul Mishkaat, #390)\].

37. And ʿĀʾishah (radhiAllahu' anhaa) narrates that the Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh said **The siwaak is a means of
  cleansing the mouth and pleasing the Lord.** \[al-Bukhārī reports
  it in mu'allaq form - connected by Aḥmad, an- Nasaa'ee, Ibn
  Khuzaymah and Ibn Ḥibbān\].
