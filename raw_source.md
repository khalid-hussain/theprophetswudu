 **AD-DALK (RUBBING THE WATER OVER THE BODY PARTS):** This is part of
 the
 
 _wuḍū_ authentically reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
 sallam). Al- Mustawrid ibn Shadad said: I saw the Emissary of Allah (sailallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) when he made _wuḍū_ rubbing his toes with his litle
 finger. \[_ṣaḥīḥ_ as has preceded\].

36. Abdullah ibn Zayd \mabpwhim narrates that the Prophet
  (sallallaahu'alaihiwasallam) made _wuḍū_ and said **Rub in this
  way.** \[See Nail-ul- Autaar, 4/39\].

37. He \mabpwhim also narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) made _wuḍū_ with two thirds of a mudd **\[3\]**
  (of water) and rubbed over his forearms. \[Ibn Khuzaymah (#118),
  and its _isnād_ is _ṣaḥīḥ_ - and al-Haakim (1/161) reports it by way
  of Yahyaa ibn Abi Zaa'idah\].

PERFORMING THE _wuḍū_ IN THE ORDER MENTIONED IN THE AYAAH
========================================================

 As for what is narrated regarding the 'order' as mentioned in the
 Aayah, then there is nothing to contradict that - and this order is
 obligatory (_wājib_) and it is said: Sunnah. \[See Fiqh al Imam Sa'eed
 ibn al Musayyib, 1/64\].
 
 As for what is related with regard to the Prophet's _wuḍū_ (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) then it has been reported sometimes out of the
 regular order. And the proof is:

36. Al-Miqdaam ibn Ma'd Yakrib said: I came to the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) with water for _wuḍū_ , so he washed his hands
  three times, then washed his face three times, then washed his
  forearms three times, then washed his mouth and nose three times,
  then wiped his head and ears - their outsides and insides - and
  washed each of his feet three times. \[Aḥmad (4/132), Abū Dāwūd
  (1/19) with _ṣaḥīḥ_ _isnād_. Ash-Shaukaanee (1/1\~5) said: Its _isnād_
  is good, and it is reported

 by ad-Diyaa in 'al-Mukhtaarah'. And al-Albānī records it in
 'as-_ṣaḥīḥ_ah', #261\]
 
 .
 
 So this is a proof that he \pbuh did not
 always stick to the regular order - and this is a proof that it is not
 obligatory - however, his sticking to it mostly shows that it is
 Sunnah. And Allah Knows best.
 
 As-Suyooti says as is reported from him in 'Aun al Ma'bood' ( 1/48):
 It is used as a proof - that is the aforementioned _ḥadīth_ - by him
 who says that sticking to the regular order in _wuḍū_ is not obligatory
 as he washed his mouth and nose after washing his arms.
 
 The author of 'Aun al Ma'bood' says: This narration is 'shaadh'
 **\[4\]** - and therefore not to be taken in contradiction to the
 established narrations which put the washing of the mouth and nose
 before the washing of the face.
 
 I say: The difference of opinion between the scholars here is with
 regard to those parts of _wuḍū_ which are Sunnah. As for the obligatory
 duties - then they are according to the order mentioned in the noble
 Aayah, and the best thing is to perform all of the actions in the way
 mentioned in the majority of the ahaadeeth - and Allah Knows best.

AL-MAWAALAAT (WASHING EACH PART DIRECTLY AFTER THE PREVIOUS ONE - LEAVING NO TIME GAP IN BETWEEN)
=================================================================================================

 Nothing other than this is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam). It is however established that Ibn 'Umar
 (radhiAllahu' anhu) urinated within the market, then made _wuḍū_ and
 so washed his face and hands and wiped his head, then he was called to
 pray over a Janazzah so he entered the mosque then wiped over his
 leather socks, then prayed over it. \[Reported by Maalik (#72) and
 al-Baihaqee (1/84). And 'Ataa didn't see anything wrong with leaving
 such gaps whilst making _wuḍū_ and it is the saying of al-Hasan,
 an-Nakha'ee and the better reported of the two sayings of
 ash-Shaafi'ee\].

BEGINNING WITH THE RIGHT
========================

 That is washing the right hand before the left - and likewise the
 feet.

36. 'Aaishah (radhiAllahu 'annaa) said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) used to like to begin with the right in putting
  on shoes, combing his hair, in purification and in all of his
  affairs. \[al-Bukhārī (al Fatḥ) 1/235, Muslim (#267) and
  others\].

37. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim narrates that the Prophet
  \pbuh said **When you dress and when you
  make _wuḍū_ , then begin with the right.** \[Abū Dāwūd (4141),
  al-Tirmidhī (1766), al-Nasāʾī (402). Al- Albaanee declares it to
  be _ṣaḥīḥ_\].

ECONOMIZING IN THE USE OF WATER AND NOT BEING WASTEFUL
======================================================

36. Anas \mabpwhim said: The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) used to make _wuḍū_ with a mudd (of water) and make ghusl
  with a saa' or up to five mudds. \[Muslim (1/156) and others\]. A
  saa' is equal to four mudds. ( A mudd is that amount of water which
  is held by the two hands cupped together.)

 If you consider this _ḥadīth_ well, O my Muslim Brother, you would feel
 ashamed of what some people do these days - one of them opening the
 water tap and making _wuḍū_ and sometimes talking to his companion
 whilst the water is running out - what an excess in wastefulness! So
 he who does that should fear Allah and remember this _ḥadīth_ and keep
 it in mind and follow the Sunnah with regard to using the water
 sparingly and not being wasteful - and here the true following of the
 Prophet \pbuh is made clear and the true
 Muslim's belief. It is from the Sunnah for the Muslim who wishes to
 make _wuḍū_ to have with him a container large enough for a mudd of
 water - in order to force himself to return to the following of the
 Sunnah.

THE DU'AA AFTER THE _wuḍū_
=========================

36. 'Umar ibn al-Khattaab \mabpwhim said: the Emissary of Allah
  (sallallaahu 'alahi wa sallam) said **None of you makes _wuḍū_ and
  completes the _wuḍū_ then says:**

 **Ashhadu anlaa ilaaha illallaahu wahdahu laa shareekalahu washhadu
 anna Muhammadan ʿAbduhu wa rasooluhu** (I bear witness that none has
 the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His
 slave andMessenger) **except that all eight Gates of Paradise are
 opened for him - so that he enters by whichever he pleases.**
 \[Reported by Muslim (#234), Abū Dāwūd (no 169), al-Tirmidhī
 (#55), al-Nasāʾī (#148), Ibn Mājah (#470)\].
 
 And al-Tirmidhī adds an authentic addition to it:
 
 **Allahumma aj'alnee minat-tawwabeen waj'alnee minal mutatahhireen**
 (O Allah, make me one of those who constantly repents toYou and of
 those who purify themselves.) \[Declared as Sahih by al-Albānī\].

36. Abū Sa'eed al-Khudree \mabpwhim said the Emissary of Allah
  \pbuhsaid **Whoever makes _wuḍū_ then says
  upon finishing the _wuḍū_:**

 **Subhaanakallaahumma wa bihamdika ashhadu anlaa ilaaha illa anta
 astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilaika** (I declare You free from all defects
 my Lord and all praise belongs to you and I bear witness that there is
 none worthy of worship except You. I seek Your forgiveness and I turn
 to You) **It is written in a parchment, then sealed and is not opened
 till Judgement Day.** \[Reported by Ibn ar-Sunnee in 'Amal al Yaurn
 wal-l\~ilah, #30. Declared as _ṣaḥīḥ_ by al-Albānī\].

WASHING EACH BODY-PART ONCE
===========================

 68\. Ibn 'Abbaas \mabpwhim said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) made _wuḍū_ (washing each part) once. \[al-Bukhārī
 (al Fatḥ) 1/226\].

WASHING EACH BODY-PART TWICE
============================

59. ʿAbd Allāh ibn Zayd narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi
  wa sallam) made _wuḍū_ (washing each part) twice. \[al-Bukhārī (al
  Fatḥ) 1/226\].

WASHING EACH BODY-PART THRICE
=============================

59. In the _ḥadīth_ of ʿUthmān \mabpwhim recorded by
  al-Bukhārī and Muslim, he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) washed
  each of the parts three times.

 So from these ahaadeeth it becomes clear to us that, as is well-known
 to the large majority of scholars, washing each body-part once is
 obligatory - and the second and third washings are Sunnah - and it is
 better to do likewise following the Sunnah of the Prophet (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) \['al-Majmoo' of al-Nawawī, 1/229\].

THE DESIRABILITY OF MAKING _wuḍū_ FOR EACH PRAYER
================================================

 Al-Haafiz says in 'al Fatḥ' (1/172) in the question 'Making _wuḍū_
 without having broken it':

59. Anas \mabpwhim says: The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) used to make _wuḍū_ for every prayer. I said: What had you
  (the Sahaabah) used to do? He said: One _wuḍū_ was sufficient for us
  till such time as we broke it.

 This _ḥadīth_ is an evidence that what is meant generally is the
 obligatory Prayer.
 
 Al-Tahaawee says: It may be that that was obligatory upon him
 \pbuh particularly - then was abrogated on
 the Day of Fatḥ by the _ḥadīth_ of Buraidah - meaning that which Muslim
 reports - that he \pbuh prayed all the
 Prayers on the Day of Fatḥ with one _wuḍū_ and that 'Umar
 
 \mabpwhim asked him about that so he (sallallaahu 'alaihi
 wa sallam) said **I did it deliberately.** Or it may be that he
 \pbuh used to do it out of desirability
 only, then feared that it might be thought to be obligatory and so
 left it to show the permissibility of that.
 
 I say: The result is that making _wuḍū_ for every Prayer is mustahabb
 and praying all of the Prayers with one _wuḍū_ is permissible - and
 Allah Knows best.

THE ONE WHO IS NOT SURE IF HE HAS BROKEN THE _wuḍū_ OR NOT RELIES UPON THAT WHICH HE IS CERTAIN OF
=================================================================================================

 If he who knows that he has made _wuḍū_ then is not sure that he has
 broken it - then his _wuḍū_ remains. And he who knows that he has done
 that which breaks _wuḍū_ and doubts when he has made _wuḍū_ thereafter
 then he does not have _wuḍū_ . In each case he relies upon that which
 he is certain of before that which he has doubt about - and he throws
 the doubt away. And this is the saying of the great majority of
 scholars - and it is the saying of Abū Hanifah, ash-Shaafi'ee and
 Aḥmad. \[_al-Mughnī_, 1/193, and \~iqh ul Awaaa'ee, 1/56\].

59. And the proof for this is what is established from Abū Hurayrah
  \mabpwhim who said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) said **If one of you feels something in his stomach and he
  isn't sure did anything (wind) come out of it or not - then let him
  not leave the mosque until he hears a sound or finds a smell.**
  \[Muslim (Sharh al-Nawawī, 4/51), 'Aaridat-ul-Ahwadhee Sharh ut-
  Tirmidhee, 1/79\].

 So the _ḥadīth_ is a proof that things remain upon their original state
 until there is a certainty of a change in that, and doubt does not
 harm that - so he who is sure of having made _wuḍū_ and thinks that he
 may have broken it, then he remains upon _wuḍū_ .

A MAN AND WOMAN'S WASHING FROM A SINGLE VESSEL
==============================================

59. Ibn 'Abbaas (radhiAllahu 'anhumaa) narrates that one of the wives
  of the Prophet \pbuh took a ghusl from
  Janaabah then saw the Emissary of Allah \pbuh about
  to take a ghusl from the water remaining - so she informed him that
  she had made ghusl therefrom - so Rasoolulah said **Nothing makes
  the water impure.** \[Reported by Abū Dāwūd (#67), and
  al-Nasāʾī (#326), and al-Tirmidhī who declared it to be hasan
  _ṣaḥīḥ_, and Ibn Mājah (#370)\].

 Ibn ʿAbd ul-Barr says: There is nothing in the Sharee'ah to prevent
 each of them washing with the water remaining from the other - either
 together or one after the other, and this is the saying of the
 scholars of the different lands and the great majority of scholars -
 and the ahaadeeth about it are Mutawaatir. (Al-Istidhkaar, 1/373).

MAKING _wuḍū_ AFTER EATING CAMEL MEAT
====================================

59. Jaabir ibn Samurah \mabpwhim narrates that a man asked
  the Emissary of Allah \pbuh: Should I make _wuḍū_
  because of the meat of sheep?

 He \pbuh said **If you wish make _wuḍū_ and
 if you wish then do not make _wuḍū_.** He said: Should I make _wuḍū_
 from the meat of the camel? He \pbuh said
 **Yes, make _wuḍū_ from the meat of the camel.** He asked: May I pray
 in sheep-pens? He \pbuh said **Yes.** He
 asked: May I pray in the stalls of camels? He (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
 sallam) said **#** \[Reported by Muslim, 1/189\].

DRYING THE BODY PARTS AFTER PURIFICATION
========================================

 'Uthman ibn 'Affaan, al- Hasan ibn 'Alee, Anas ibn Maalik, al-Hasan
 al-Basree, Ibn Seereen, 'Alqamah, al-Aswad, Masrooq, ad-Dahhaak,
 ʿAbd Allāh ibn al Haarith, Abū Ya'laa, Abūl Ahwas, Ash-Sha'bee,
 Ath-Thawree, Ishaaq, Ibn 'Umar in a narration, and Abū Hanifah,
 Maalik, Aḥmad, and the Shafi'ee Madhhab in one saying, all say that it
 is permissible after both _wuḍū_ and ghusl to dry the body-parts. And
 their evidence is what ʿĀʾishah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) reports - she
 said: the Emissary of Allah \pbuh had a cloth which he
 used to dry himself with after making _wuḍū_ . \[Reported by
 al-Tirmidhī who declared it to be da'eef\]. Then al Ainee states that
 al-Nasāʾī records it in 'al-Kunaa' with _ṣaḥīḥ_ _isnād_.
 
 I say: And it has other narrations which support and strengthen it.
 (See Fiqh al- Imam Sa'eed, 1/70). al-Albānī declares the _ḥadīth_ to
 be hasan. (_ṣaḥīḥ_ ul Jaami', 4706).

59. Salmaan al-Faarsee narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) made _wuḍū_ , then turned up a woollen cloak he had and wiped
  his face with it. \[Reported by Ibn Mājah (#468)\]. In
  az-Zawaa'id it is said: Its _isnād_ is _ṣaḥīḥ_.

 I say: In its _isnād_ is al-Wadeen ibn 'Ataa who is sadooq but has a
 bad memory as al-Haafiz Ibn Ḥajr says in 'Taqreeb ut-Tahdheeb', so its
 _isnād_ is da'eef!! - but it is strengthened by the previous _ḥadīth_ of
 ʿĀʾishah to the level of hasan - and Allah Knows best.
 
 Some others hold it to be makrooh to dry the body-parts after
 Purification and their proof is:

59. What is established from Maimoonah (radhiAllahu'anhaa) who
  described the Prophet's \pbuh ghusl from
  Janaabah and said: Then I brought him a cloth but he refused it.
  \[al-Bukhārī, and Muslim - and the word is his\].

 The Final word: Is that drying the body-parts is one of the desirable
 actions as shown by the _ḥadīth_ of Aa'ishah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) - as
 for the saying that it is makrooh then that is not acceptable as the
 saying of Maimoonah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) "but he refused it" does not
 amount to the fact that it is makrooh - and Allah Knows best.

THOSE THINGS WHICH BREAK _wuḍū_
==============================

THAT WHICH COMES OUT FROM THE TWO PRIVATE PARTS (FRONT AND BACK):
=================================================================

 Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) said **Allah does not accept the prayer of any one
 of you having committed hadath until he makes _wuḍū_.** \[al-Bukhārī
 (al Fatḥ, 1/206) and Muslim (#245)\].

59. al-Nawawī says in 'al-Majmoo' (2/3) as for that which comes out of
  the two private parts - then it breaks _wuḍū_ according to Allah
  ta'alas saying: Aw jaa'a ahadukum min al ghaa'it...: or one of you
  comes from offices of nature...\[Soorat-ul-Maa'idah 5:7\] along with
  his \pbuh saying **There is no _wuḍū_
  except from a sound or a smell.** \[_ṣaḥīḥ_ and has preceded (_ṣaḥīḥ_
  ul Jaarni' (7443)\].

 He adds: So that which comes out of the front or back part of a man or
 woman breaks the _wuḍū_ - whether excretion or urine or wind - or a
 worm or pus or blood or stones or anything else and there is no
 difference in that for something which happens normally or rarely.

(1) **SOUND SLEEP \[5\]**

59. 'Alee ibn Abi Taalib \mabpwhim said: the Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh said **The eye is the drawstring for
  the anus, so he who sleeps then let him make _wuḍū_.** \[Abū Dāwūd
  (#203), Ibn Mājah (#477), Aḥmad. Declared as _ṣaḥīḥ_ by
  al-Albānī\].

 In the _ḥadīth_ is an evidence that sleep does not in itself something
 that breaks _wuḍū_ , however the Purification is broken if it is
 possible for something to come out from the anus - however if that is
 restricted, e.g. by sitting flat on the earth, then that is not the
 case.

(1) **BECOMING UNCONSCIOUS - OTHER THAN SLEEP**

 That is the 'intellect' going away by any means because of insanirt or
 fainting or intoxication - as in this condition he does not know
 whether his _wuḍū_ is broken or not. This is the saying of the great
 majority of scholars. (Sharh _ṣaḥīḥ_ Muslim (4/74) and al-Mughnee
 (1/164)).

(1) Touching the Uncovered Private Parts 69. Abū Hurayrah (radhiAllahu
  'anhu) said: the Emissary of Allah \pbuh said **If
  one of you touches his penis and there is no veil between him and it
  nor any cover, then _wuḍū_ has become obligatory for him.**
  \[al-Haakim (1/138) and others\]. (al-Albānī says: _ḥadīth_
  _ṣaḥīḥ_.)

(2) **TOUCHING THE PENIS**

70. Busrah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu 'alaihi
  wa sallam) said **If one of you touches his penis then let him make
  _wuḍū_.** \[al-Tirmidhī (1/18) who said it is hasan _ṣaḥīḥ_. And also
  declared as _ṣaḥīḥ_ by Aḥmad, al- Bukhaaree and Ibn Ma'een (Lum'aat
  ut-Tanqeeh Sharh Mishkaat ul Masaabeeh, #319). Others also narrate
  it as authentic\].

71. Talq ibn 'Alee \mabpwhim said: the Emissary of Allah
  (sallallaahu'alaihi wa sallam) was asked about a man's touching his
  penis. Should he make _wuḍū_ ? He \pbuh
  said **And is it except a part of him?** \[al-Tirmidhī (#85) and
  he said: And this is the best of what is reported in this regard\].
  Al- Albaanee says: Its _isnād_ is _ṣaḥīḥ_, and this (the view that it
  doesn't break the _wuḍū_) is established as being that of a group of
  the Sahaabah, from them: Ibn Mas'ood, 'Ammaar ibn Yaasir, and
  because of these Imam Aḥmad gave the choice between this and the one
  before it. Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah harmonized the two
  carrying the first to mean if he touched it with desire and this
  upon the touching without desire - and there is in this _ḥadīth_ that
  which gives that impression and it is his (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) saying 'a part of him'. \[Al-Mishkaat al Masaabeeh, notes on
  nos.3 19 and 320\].

(1) **TOUCHING A WOMAN WITH DESIRE**

70. A man's touching a woman without desire does not break the _wuḍū_ .
  ʿĀʾishah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) says: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) prayed and I was lying in front of him as in
  front of a Janaazah, so when he wished to prostrate I pulled up my
  leg. \[al-Bukhārī and Muslim\].

71. And in the same way a woman's touching a man without desire does not
  break _wuḍū_ as is established from ʿĀʾishah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa):
  I didn't find the Prophet \pbuh one night
  so I tried to find him with my hand - and my hand fell upon his feet
  which were raised up as he was making prostration. \[Muslim (3/203)
  and al-Nasāʾī (l/101)\].

 So we see from these two _ḥadīth_ that merely touching does not break
 the _wuḍū_ - and Allah Knows best.
 
 The author of'at-Ta'leeqaat us-Salafiyyah' upon Sunan of al-Nasāʾī
 (1/23) says concerning "he pushed me with his foot": It is well-known
 that that is a touching without desire. And so the author uses it as a
 proof that touching without desire does not break the _wuḍū_ . As for
 the touching with desire - its proof is that the _wuḍū_ is not broken
 until a proof is established that it does indeed break it - and this
 is enough of a proof to show that it doesn't break the _wuḍū_ for the
 one who holds that view - and above and beyond that is a further proof
 that it doesn't break the _wuḍū_ is the _ḥadīth_ of kissing - as
 normally kissing is not free from touching with desire.
 
 The author of 'Aun al Ma'bood' (1/69) says regarding her saying "he
 kissed me and did not make _wuḍū_"' - It contains a proof that touching
 a woman does not break the _wuḍū_ as kissing is part of touching and
 the Prophet \pbuh did not make _wuḍū_ (before
 praying). And this (that touching a woman even with desire doesn't
 break the _wuḍū_ ) is the saying of 'Alee and Ibn 'Abbaas and 'Ataa ibn
 Taawoos, and Abū Hanifah and Sufyaan ath-Thawree. And this _ḥadīth_ is
 (in itself) da'eef but is supported by other narrations. And it is
 mursal - however ad- Daaraqutnee joins it - and it is (therefore) an
 authentic (_ṣaḥīḥ_) _ḥadīth_ inshaaAllah. (See Nasb ur Raayah, l/70).
 
 The author of _al-Mughnī_ (1/190) says: The touching is not in itself
 something which breaks _wuḍū_ but breaks _wuḍū_ as it leads to
 prostratic fluid or semen being emitted - so the condition which leads
 to breaking of the _wuḍū_ is considered - and that is when there is
 desire.
 
 Summary: That when a man and woman are safe from anything being
 emitted which breaks _wuḍū_ - then their _wuḍū_ is not broken; and it is
 preferable to be on the safe side, as they may not be safe from such
 emissions in the condition of desire - and Allah Knows best.
 
 **CONCLUSION**
 
 This is what Allah ta'ala has made easy for us to gather together
 about the _wuḍū_ and its rulings, so we hope from Allah the Most High,
 the All-Powerful, that we have been able to do justice to the subject
 - and we hope that any scholarly solicitous brother who comes across
 anything in our booklet which is incorrect to cover up and give
 sincere advice. And it is Allah who grants success.
