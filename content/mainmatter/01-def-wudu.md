# The Definition of Wuḍū

Linguistically, _wuḍū_ is the action, and _waḍū_ the water used therefore -- and
it is also a verbal noun; or they are two forms of the same word, both meaning
the verbal noun and maybe both referring also to the water used.

According to the Sharīʿah, _wuḍū_ is using clean and cleansing (_ṭahūr_) water
upon certain body parts as Allāh has prescribed and explained.
