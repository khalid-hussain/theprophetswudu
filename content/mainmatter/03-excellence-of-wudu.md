    «Shall I not guide you to that by which Allāh wipes away the sins and raises
    the ranks?» They said, ‘Certainly O Emissary of Allāh!’ He BPBUH said,
    «Completing the _wuḍū_ when it is a hardship, many steps to the mosques, and
    waiting for the [next] prayer after the prayer, that is _al-Ribāṭ_
    (defending the frontiers); that is _al-Ribāṭ_; that is _al-Ribāṭ_.»”

   “When the Muslim (or 'Believing') servant makes _wuḍū_ and washes his face
   then the sin of everything he looked at with his eye comes away with the
   water, or with the last drop of the water, and when he washes his hands then
   the sin of everything he stretched out his hands to comes away with the
   water, or with the last drop of the water. And when he washes his feet every
   sin which his feet walked towards comes away with the water or with the last
   drop of the water---so that he leaves clean (clear/pure) from sins.”[^8]

7. Abū Hurayrah BP_HIM reports that Emissary of Allāh BPBUH came to the
   graveyard and said, “Peace be upon you, dwelling of Believing People and we
   will (all) if Allāh wills join you soon. I would have liked to have seen our
   brothers!” They said, “Are we not your brothers, O Emissary of Allāh?” He
   BPBUH said, “You are my Companions and our brothers are those who have not
   yet come!” They said, “How will you know those who have not yet come from
   your _Ummah_, O Emissary of Allāh?” He said, “Have you not seen that if a man
   had a horse with a white blaze and hoof along with a totally jet-black horse,
   then would he not know his horse?” They said, “Certainly, O Emissary of
   Allāh.” He said, “So they will come with white blazes and marks from the
   _wuḍū_ and I am present before them at the Hand (_water-tank_). Indeed men
   will be driven away from my _water-tank_ as the lost camel is driven away
   from their gathering place. ‘Come on.’ So it will be said: ‘Indeed they have
   made changes after you,’ so I will say, ‘Be off, be off.’”[^9]

   “Purification is half of Īmān; and _alḥamdulillāh_ fills the Scales; and

   earth; and _Ṣalāh_ is a light; and _Ṣadaqah_ is a clear proof; and _Ṣabr_
   (patience) is a shining light; and the Quran is a proof for or against you.
   Every person starts the day dealing for his own soul so he either sets it
   free or destroys it.”[^11]

    wipe away his evil deeds and his right foot continually writes for him good
    deeds until he enters the masjid. And if the people knew what there was in
    the night prayer and Subh prayers, then they would come to them even if they
    had to crawl.”[^14]
