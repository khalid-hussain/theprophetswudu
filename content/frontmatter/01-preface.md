# Preface {.unnumbered}

Verily, all praise is for Allāh, we praise Him and seek His aid and ask for His
forgiveness, and we seek refuge with Allāh from the evils of ourselves and our
evil actions. Whomever Allāh guides there is none who can misguide him, and
whomever Allāh misguides there is none who can guide him, and I bear witness
that none has the right to be worshiped except Allāh Alone, having no partner,
and I bear witness that Muḥammad is His slave and His Messenger.

يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱتَّقُواْ رَبَّكُمُ ٱلَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفۡسٖ
وَٰحِدَةٖ وَخَلَقَ مِنۡهَا زَوۡجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنۡهُمَا رِجَالٗا كَثِيرٗا
وَنِسَآءٗۚ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ ٱلَّذِي تَسَآءَلُونَ بِهِۦ وَٱلۡأَرۡحَامَۚ
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيۡكُمۡ رَقِيبٗا ١

O mankind! Revere your Guardian-Lord, Who created you from a single person,
created, of like nature, his mate, and from them twain scattered countless men
and women; revere Allāh, through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and
(revere) the wombs (that bore you): for Allāh ever watches over you. (al-Nisā,
Q4:1)

O you who have believed, fear Allāh and speak words of appropriate justice. He
will [then] amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever
obeys Allāh and His Messenger has certainly attained a great attainment.
(al-Aḥzāb, Q33:70--71)

As for what follows: Verily the most truthful speech is the Word of Allāh and
the best guidance is the guidance of Muḥammad \hon{\PBUH}{\BODY}, and the worst of
affairs are the novelties and every novelty is an innovation and every
innovation is a going astray and every going astray is in the Fire.

I desired to write this as a completion for the treatises which are in
circulation amongst the people today -- about the different fields -- especially
of worship such as prayer and fasting, etc. which have made easier that which is
difficult with regard to religious rulings and being guided thereby, as it maybe
difficult these days for some to read, research, and extract these rulings from
their places within the source books, either because of the ignorance of the
Muslims, laziness, or some other worldly problems. I sincerely advise all the
Muslims to read and research until they come to know and understand their true
_Dīn_.

I wished to write this in order to complete the series of the types of worship,
especially since no one has particularized this topic in a treatise -- except
what occurs within the books of reference as we have explained -- but I have not
found this in the form of a treatise.

My method for this treatise has been not to quote except what is authentic from
the _ḥadīth_ of the Messenger of Allāh \hon{\PBUH}{\BODY} -- if Allāh wishes --
ordering it according to the order of the _wuḍū_ of the Messenger of Allāh
\hon{\PBUH}{\BODY}, and I have commented on some of the points about which there
is difference of opinion, stating that which is correct therefrom in our view
after replying to the other opinions.

I ask Allāh to guide us to that which is proper. Verily He is the One having
authority over that and having the Power to do so.
